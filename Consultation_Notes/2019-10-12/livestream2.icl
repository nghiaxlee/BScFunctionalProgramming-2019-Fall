//Starting with RECURSION
/*
Recursion is repeating something.
Recursion has two parts.
    1. What is the repeated action?
        a. What are we doing over and over again?
        b. How does it repeat?
    2. What is the stop condition?
        a. When do we stop the recursion?
        b. How do we stop the recursion?
        c. What do we do after we stop the recursion?

/*
    1. What is the repeated action?
        a. What are we doing over and over again? -> multiplication
        b. How does it repeat? -> multiply by the next number down.
    2. What is the stop condition?
        a. When do we stop the recursion? -> when we hit 1
        b. How do we stop the recursion? -> multiply by 1
        c. What do we do after we stop the recursion? -> nothing else
