Public Repo for ELTE BSc Functional Programming Friday sections 1200pm-1400pm and 1400pm-1600pm
This is the public repository for all files used in the Friday sections 1200pm-1400pm and 1400pm - 1600pm.
Additional practice and help files may be uploaded here as well.
For those who need help with Git, you can learn some more over at: https://learngitbranching.js.org/
Though to be perfectly honest, most of Git is learned by using it, and via trial and error.
