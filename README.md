# Eötvös Loránd University BSc Functional Programming - Fall 2019 Public Repository

## General Info
This is the public repository for all files used in the Friday sections 1200pm-1400pm and 1400pm - 1600pm.
Additional practice and help files may be uploaded here as well. For those who need help with Git, you can learn some more over at: [https://learngitbranching.js.org/](https://learngitbranching.js.org/) Though to be perfectly honest, most of Git is learned by using it, and via trial and error.

## Contact Me
I am best reachable via [my email](sitt.evan@gmail.com). I check this pretty frequently.
Alternatively, you may also choose to add me on [my Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/Evan.Sitt) and message me via Messenger, although please keep in mind that I may not be able to reply instantly.

**Please, feel free to contact me about anything.**

Functional Programming, and Clean itself, are far from the easiest things to pick up. This course is no breeze either. For some, it will click right away, and for some it will click later. Or even never.

***This is okay.***

You're all good at something different. I'm here to help you with Functional Programming, so please let me help you. No question is a dumb question, and I want you to please ask any and all questions during class. If we have no time during class to address your questions, please bring them up during consultation or contact me to set up an appointment.
